## [0.1.0] - 2025-08-04

### ‚ú® Added

#### **Core Cache Implementations**
- **LRU Cache**: Least Recently Used eviction with O(1) operations
- **LFU Cache**: Least Frequently Used eviction with frequency-based priorities
- **LFUDA Cache**: LFU with Dynamic Aging to prevent stale items from persisting
- **SLRU Cache**: Segmented LRU with probationary and protected segments for scan resistance
- **GDSF Cache**: Greedy Dual-Size Frequency for size-aware caching (ideal for CDNs)

#### **Performance Features**
- All cache operations (get, put, remove) are **O(1) time complexity**
- **hashbrown** integration by default for superior HashMap performance
- Optimized memory layout with doubly-linked lists and hash maps
- Zero-allocation cache hits for maximum performance

#### **no_std Compatibility**
- Full `no_std` support for embedded and resource-constrained environments  
- Uses `alloc` crate for heap allocations only when necessary
- Cross-platform compilation tested on `thumbv6m-none-eabi` target

#### **Comprehensive Metrics System**
- Built-in metrics tracking for all cache implementations
- Algorithm-specific metrics (hit rates, eviction patterns, aging events)
- Deterministic metrics ordering using `BTreeMap` for reproducible analysis
- Integration-ready for performance monitoring and simulation systems

#### **Safety & Reliability**
- **66 comprehensive SAFETY comments** documenting all unsafe code blocks
- Extensive unsafe code for performance with safe public APIs
- Memory safety guaranteed through careful pointer management
- Industry-standard safety practices following Rust unsafe code guidelines

#### **Developer Experience**
- **94 comprehensive tests** covering all algorithms and edge cases
- **35 documentation tests** with working examples
- **6 integration tests** for no_std compatibility
- Extensive benchmarking suite with Criterion.rs
- Algorithm selection guide in documentation

#### **Feature Flags**
- `hashbrown` (default): Use hashbrown for better HashMap performance
- `nightly`: Enable nightly-only optimizations when available  
- `std`: Enable standard library features (opposite of no_std)

#### **Documentation & Examples**
- Complete API documentation with mathematical algorithm descriptions
- Performance characteristics and time/space complexity analysis
- When-to-use guidance for each algorithm
- Working examples: `cache_comparison.rs`, `metrics_demo.rs`
- Comprehensive README with quick start guide

### üéØ **Use Cases**

- **Web Applications**: HTTP response caching, session storage
- **CDNs**: Size-aware content caching with GDSF
- **Databases**: Buffer pools, query result caching
- **Embedded Systems**: Resource-constrained caching with no_std
- **High-Frequency Trading**: Ultra-low latency data caching
- **Game Development**: Asset caching, world state management

### üìù **Project Statistics**

- **~7,500 lines** of carefully crafted Rust code
- **5 cache algorithms** with distinct use cases
- **Comprehensive safety documentation** for all unsafe operations
- **MIT licensed** for maximum compatibility
- **Production-ready** architecture following Rust best practices
